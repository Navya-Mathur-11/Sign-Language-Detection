Sign Language Detection Using YOLOv8
Technologies: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, PyTorch

-> Built a real-time object detection model for 5 sign language gestures (hello, thankyou, yes, no, iloveyou) using YOLOv8.

-> Labeled custom dataset in YOLO format and trained the model from pretrained weights.

-> Achieved 99.5% mAP@0.5 and 89.5% mAP@0.5:0.95 on validation.

-> Developed inference pipeline to predict gestures on live or test images.

-> Optimized for Apple M1 chip and CPU-only environments.
